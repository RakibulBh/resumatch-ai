              <p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>Football League Manager</strong> | <em>Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, PostgreSQL</em> <span style="float: right;"><strong>May 2024</strong></span></p>
              <ul style="margin: 5px 0 10px 20px;">
                  <li>Solved the problem of managing a mini football league where admins can schedule football matches and add players into teams for each match, players can see their team stats as well as past football matches, the software also tracks player stats and displays a leaderboard with a score for each player.</li>
                  <li>Developed using Next.js and Supabase for auth and a hosted PostgreSQL Database. Using features such as Server-Side Rendering sped up my application by 44% giving users a better experience, along with using Tailwind-CSS and Shadcn-UI to speed up the development time by 50%.</li>
              </ul>

              <p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>ResuMatch.ai</strong> | <em>Next.js, Supabase, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Clerk, OpenAI</em> <span style="float: right;"><strong>Jun 2024</strong></span></p>
              <ul style="margin: 5px 0 10px 20px;">
                  <li>This software allows users to upload their CV (which is parsed into text) and a job description, the information is then passed into an AI model which tailors the CV to match the job description. Users have limited credits to which they can use to tailor their CV, unlimited credits and more features are given to monthly paying customers.</li>
                  <li>Clerk allowed countless of hours saved towards building authentication allowing me to focus more of my time on building the core features. OpenAI’s API allowed me to communicate between their AI Models and my frontend application. Additionally, TypeScript’s type safety features made sure I was able to code efficiently saving me time while debugging the app.</li>
              </ul>

              <p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>AI-Powered Habit Tracker</strong> | <em>Next.js, Supabase, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Clerk, Gemini AI</em> <span style="float: right;"><strong>Jun 2024</strong></span></p>
              <ul style="margin: 5px 0 10px 20px;">
                  <li>Solved the problem of people not being able to track their progress into improving their daily lives and building new habits, this software allows users to get personalised feedback from Gemini AI as well as personalised graphs to show user progress when creating their own customised habits.</li>
                  <li>Developed by using the Gemini AI API instead of Open AI API as it sped up the fetching process by a staggering 20%, this gave users a better experience while using the app, techniques such as database normalisation allowed efficient store of memory in the PostgreSQL database allowing me to save money on hosting the database.</li>
              </ul>

If the resume has an interest section i want you to add some interests that could match the job's description, if the resume has a summary section i want you to change it slightly to match the job description.

I want you to copy the exact styling like this html code i have provided, the same sizes, the same way sections are made, it doesn't neccesarily have to be the same format (for example sections can be in different orders) but this should be the guide for you to create resumes, look at how the dates are positioned, i need you to make sure positioning is almost identical (e.g space between each line in the same section is minimal etc..). Another main thing would be, under each section when you are listing different things they must have bullet points, just like my example html code has, bulletpoints are essential, keep the text also same size, watch for the bolding; look what words are bold and what arent (titles are bold and text is not), dates should also be bold.
